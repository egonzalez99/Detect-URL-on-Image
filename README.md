## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detection of URL Embedded Inside Images

This project was inspired by a cybersecurity topic covered in class, which sparked my interest in how malicious content can be hidden in seemingly harmless files. During my research, I discovered **steganography**‚Äîthe practice of concealing information within digital media such as images or text.

To explore this concept further, I developed a program using **Python** and **HTML** that allows users to upload an image. The application scans the image at the pixel level to detect anomalies that could indicate hidden messages. If a hidden **URL** or **text** is embedded within the image, the program will attempt to decrypt it and display its contents in a pop-up window.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The detection process may not work 100% of the time, as results depend on the method and complexity of the steganography used. However, if any hidden content is found, it will be revealed in a pop-up alert.

This project combines elements of **cybersecurity**, **image processing**, and **forensics**, offering a hands-on exploration into how digital media can be exploited‚Äîand how those threats can be detected.
